                        <p>The Tooele Valley had no permanent settlement when Mormon pioneers entered the Great Salt Lake Valley in July 1847; 
                        it was covered with abundant tall grass. The Mormons first used the valley as wintering grounds for their herds. 
                        In September 1849, three families settled on a small stream south of present Tooele City. Other families slowly joined them, 
                        and by 1853 Tooele City Corporation was organized.</p>
                        <p>During the nineteenth century, the town was primarily an agricultural community; its population was about 1,200 at the turn of the century.</p>
                        <p>The 20th century brought more industrialization; in 1905 the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad built a line through the city, and in 1909 a 
                            smelter was built in Carr Fork Canyon east of the city ("International Smelting and Refining Company"). The Tooele Valley Railway, a seven-mile 
                            line, ran from the smelter west to the Union Pacific Railroad main line. This line brought ore from various area mines to the smelter; later a 
                            20,000 ft aerial tramway was also used to transport ore from the mine to the smelter. By 1941 a 22,000 ft tunnel had been completed through the 
                            mountain, to move ore to the smelter entirely underground. The smelter began processing copper in 1910, with lead and zinc processing commencing 
                            in 1912. In 1946 the copper smelter ceased operation, the zinc operation halted in 1968, and the lead processing was halted in 1972. The entire 
                            site was demolished during 1972-74. However, consideration was being given during this latter period to extracting ore from Carr Fork Canyon, 
                            rather than relying on the ore from the east face of the mountain range. In 1969 the mining company began exploration drilling. In 1974 a copper 
                            mine and mill ("Carr Fork Operations") was started; it began processing ore in 1979, and ran until 1981. The Tooele Valley Railway was used to haul 
                            away the scrap when the International smelter was torn down, and remained to serve the Pine Canyon mill. It was shut down and abandoned when the 
                            Pine Canyon “Carr Fork” mine and mill shut down; its last day of operation was 28 August 1982.<br>
