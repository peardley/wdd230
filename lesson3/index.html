    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the Weather and More website is to provide weather related information, local events listings, and 
        stories to the regions and communities of Southeast Idaho. It is a site where both locals and 
        non-locals can go to get fun and informative information about this region. A home page will contain 
        current weather forecasts and stories about the region along with navigation links to three communities 
        within the region. Communities included on this site are Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven, Idaho. 
        Each of these communities will have a devoted page with current local weather conditions and forecasts, 
        weather related news stories specific to that town, and event listings for that area.  A photo gallery 
        page will also be included as a way to showcase the people, landscapes, and events of this area. While 
        weather is a key factor of this site, it contains so much more for the viewer to enjoy.
