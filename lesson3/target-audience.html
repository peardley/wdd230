    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <h3>Age Range and Gender</h3>
    <p>Southeast Idaho provides a variety of outdoor activities available for nearly all age groups. And while 
        this site can benefit a large age span, the target age range this site will focus on is ages 20-50, both 
        male and female. This age range tends to be more active outdoors and would rely on a website to help 
        them understand what activities are available to them based on weather conditions. Because the website
        talks about outdoor and local community events, it can serve both men and women of varying educational backgrounds.

    <h3>Persona 1</h3> 
        <img src="images/manheadshot.jpg" alt="headshot of young man with a beard">
        <p><b>Name: </b>Ben Fields</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Accountant</p>
        <p><b>Demographics: </b> Not Married, BS in Accounting, 27 years old</p>
        <p><b>Hobbies: </b>Loves fishing, hunting, sports cars, and being outdoors</p>
        <p> Ben is from Salt Lake City, UT and will head over to the Fish Haven area seasonally to do some
            fishing. He enjoys bringing some of his buddies with him and making it a weekend trip. He would 
            use this site to help him see the conditions of the river or reservior he wants to fish on as well
            as check the weather forecasts to decide which weekend to fish. Because the site 
            offers tips and stories about the region, he is able to see which type of fish are biting currently
            so he knows what time of bait to purchase. He uses the photo gallery to show his friends the 
            area to entice them to join him.

    <h3>Persona 2</h3>
        <img src="images/womanheadshot.jpg" alt="headshot of a young mother">  
        <p><b>Name: </b>Jenny Walters</p>
        <p><b>Occupation: </b>Homemaker</p>
        <p><b>Demographics: </b> Married, BS in Education, 35 years old, three kids.</p>
        <p><b>Hobbies: </b>Scrap booking, restoring furniture, gardening</p>
        <p> Jenny is a mother that is always trying to keep her kids busy and outdoors. Jenny is local
            to the SE region of Idaho and uses the site frequently to see what events are happening around
            her. She loves to take her kids to local fairs and events to help them appreciate what is 
            around them. She often likes to take them on short hikes to keep up them active. She uses the 
            maps on the sites to find local hiking spots and uses the weather forecast to know how to prepare
            her kids for the hike.</p>
